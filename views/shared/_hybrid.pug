.alert.alert-primary(role="alert")
    p This process requests an 
        strong id_token 
        |directly from the authorization endpoint.

.alert.alert-warning(role="alert")
    p This requires an admin to enable this feature on the application in Azure before it can be used!

    dl.row
        dt.col-sm-2 response_type
        dd.col-sm-10 Include 
            strong id_token 
            | in the 
            strong
                |response_type  
            | to use the hybrid flow. Can still include 
            strong code 
            |to request an authroization code as well.
        dt.col-sm-2 scope
        dd.col-sm-10 A space separated list of scopes you want to user to consent to.
        dt.col-sm-2 response_mode
        dd.col-sm-10 Request the response returned in either url fragment or POST data.  Query string is not permitted in this flow.
        dt.col-sm-2 state
        dd.col-sm-10 An optional parameter that can be used to pass data in the request that will be returned in the token response. 
            |A randomly generated unique value is typically used for preventing cross-site request forgery attacks. 
            |The value can also encode information about the user's state in the app before the authentication request occurred, such as the page or view they were on.
        dt.col-sm-2 nonce
        dd.col-sm-10 This will be included in the resulting 
            strong id_token 
            |as a claim. The app can then verify this value to mitigate token replay attacks. The value is typically a randomized, unique string that can be used to identify the origin of the request.
